  <h2><u>Various Programs:-</u></h2>
  <h4><u>PLANNING:-</u></h4>I plan for the test. To begin with I will put together a detailed study schedule and identify the best resources to use during your preparation. This will be a personalized plan depending on your weaknesses and strengths and when you want to take the exam.<br><br>For these tests saving time is equally important as scores. <br>
                   
 <h4><u>PLANNING AND FOLLOW UP:-</u></h4> It consists of working together until your exam, where I give you a detailed study schedule and follow up with you until your exam, looking into your performance and modifying the strategy at every step of the journey. I also advise you when you can take the assessment and if you are ready for the test.<br><br>
Sometimes it takes years to finish even a single test, because of a lack of proper planning and guidance.
                  
<h4><u>TUTORING:-</u></h4>
When I tutor students, I am fully focused on their success- I donâ€™t aim to get my students a passing score, but give them strategies that will help them to achieve a great score. I will channel their thought process in solving the questions and help in identifying and solidifying the weak areas which are holding their performance.
